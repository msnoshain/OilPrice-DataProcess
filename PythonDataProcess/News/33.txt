"The outlook has darkened significantly since April. The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one," the IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a Tuesday news conference. The IMF official added that the downside potential for the global economy is quite significant due to major uncertainties around the supply and price of energy and food resulting from the war in Ukraine: factors that could have a strong negative effect on economic growth.
