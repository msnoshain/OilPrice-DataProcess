Brent crude topped $100 per barrel this week after the latest developments in Ukraine, which represent a sharp escalation to an open military conflict between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Sanctions against Russia announced by the UK, the EU, and the United States earlier this week also served to push prices higher on worries that Russia may decide to shrink its oil and gas exports, disrupting global supply balance. More sanctions are on the table, as well. At the time of writing, Brent crude was over $103 per barrel after touching $105, with West Texas Intermediate at close to $98 per barrel. Both benchmarks were up by more than 6 percent from opening. This is the first time since 2014 when Brent has traded over $100 per barrel. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com
